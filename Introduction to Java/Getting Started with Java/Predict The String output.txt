What is the output of the following code if the input string is "Coding Ninjas"?

Scanner s = new Scanner(System.in);
String str;
str = s.next();
System.out.print(str);

 Correct Answer
Solution Description

"s.next()" returns the next token as String. A token is part of entered line that is separated from other 
tokens by space, tab or newline. So when input line is - “Coding Ninjas” then s.next() returns the first token i.e. “Coding”
